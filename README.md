## Introduction

This repository houses the backend service for a multimedia storage solution developed using the Spring Boot framework and MongoDB database. The service provides a robust foundation for storing, organizing, and retrieving multimedia files efficiently. With the help of Docker and Docker Compose, you can easily deploy and manage the service along with its associated MongoDB instance.

## Features

- User-friendly API for uploading, retrieving, and managing multimedia files.
- Efficient storage and retrieval of images and multimedia files.
- Seamless integration with MongoDB for persistent data storage.
- Dockerized service for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the multimedia storage service, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Spring Boot and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

To get started with the multimedia storage service, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the MongoDB connection details in the `application.properties` file.
3. Build and run the Spring Boot application locally to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Usage

Once the service is up and running, you can use the API endpoints to interact with the multimedia storage:

- **Upload a file:** Use the `/api/upload` endpoint to upload multimedia files.
- **Retrieve a file:** Use the `/api/files/{fileId}` endpoint to retrieve a specific file.
- **List files:** Use the `/api/files` endpoint to list all available files.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on each endpoint.

## Configuration

In the `application.properties` file, you can configure various settings for the multimedia storage service, including MongoDB connection details, file storage paths, and more. Make sure to update the configuration according to your requirements.

## Dockerization

The service can be containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments. The provided Dockerfile includes the necessary steps to build a Docker image for the Spring Boot application.

To build the Docker images, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t java_app .
```
## Docker Compose

The included docker-compose.yml file simplifies the deployment process by setting up both the multimedia service and its MongoDB database. To deploy the service and database using Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will create and start containers for the multimedia service and MongoDB database.
